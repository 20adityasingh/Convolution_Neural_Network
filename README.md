This repository contains an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using TensorFlow and Keras.

## 📌 Features
- Implementation of CNN from scratch using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Image preprocessing and augmentation.
- Training and evaluation of the model.
- Visualization of training progress and performance metrics.
- Model prediction on test images.

## 🚀 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/20adityasingh/Convolution_Neural_Network.git
   cd Convolution_Neural_Network
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🏋️‍♂️ Training the Model
To train the CNN model, run:
```sh
python src/train.py
```

## 📊 Evaluating the Model
To evaluate the trained model, run:
```sh
python src/evaluate.py
```

## 🖼️ Making Predictions
To make predictions on new images, run:
```sh
python src/predict.py --image path/to/image.jpg
```

## 🔥 Results & Performance
- Accuracy and loss plots will be saved during training.
- Classification report and confusion matrix can be generated.
